"""
This package provides the calculator classes for the MaterialsFramework.

The package includes several calculators, each designed to interface with specific machine learning
potentials and perform material property calculations such as potential energy, forces, and stresses.
These calculators support advanced material simulations and structure relaxations.

This package serves as a centralized collection of calculator classes to streamline
the workflow of materials modeling and property prediction within the MaterialsFramework.
